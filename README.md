# ML-PROJECT
Housing Price Prediction
Introduction

This project aims to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices in Germany. As a newly appointed data scientist, you are required to design and implement this pipeline and submit it to the team lead data scientist. The project will help the company gain a competitive advantage by accurately predicting property prices, leading to increased customer satisfaction and business growth.
Problem Statement
Business Problem

The company specializes in rental apartments across Germany and seeks to improve its competitive edge by predicting property prices accurately. By doing so, the company can offer better pricing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall business performance.
Importance

Accurately predicting housing prices can provide several benefits:

    Competitive pricing strategies
    Improved customer satisfaction
    Better market analysis and trend prediction
    Increased business growth and profitability

Data Collection

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: Housing Price Prediction Dataset. This dataset includes various features relevant to housing prices, such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and several amenities.
Machine Learning Task

The task is formulated as a regression problem where the goal is to predict the continuous target variable, which is the price of the property.
Data Exploration
Dataset Characteristics

The dataset contains the following features:

    price: Price of the property (target variable)
    area: Size of the property
    bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
    bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
    stories: Number of stories
    mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea: Binary features indicating the presence of these amenities
    furnishingstatus: Categorical feature indicating the furnishing status

Data Quality Issues

    Missing values
    Outliers

Evaluation Metrics

    R-squared (RÂ²)
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Outlier Removal

Outliers were removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to ensure data quality.
Feature Scaling

Standard scaling was applied to the numerical features to normalize the data for better model performance.
Model Training
Models Used

    Support Vector Regression (SVR) with Linear Kernel
    Support Vector Regression (SVR) with RBF Kernel
    Gradient Boosting Regressor

Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV to find the optimal set of parameters for each model.
Model Assessment
Final Performance

The performance of each model was evaluated using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error on the test set.
Best Model

The best model was determined based on the highest R-squared value and the lowest Mean Absolute Error.
Conclusion
Overall Pipeline Strengths

    Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering
    Effective outlier removal
    Extensive model training and hyperparameter tuning

Limitations

    Limited feature set
    Potential for further improvement with additional data
